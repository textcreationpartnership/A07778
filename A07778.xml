            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26121:4"/>were wont to tremble, that had heretofore a crowne of glory, all to be crowned and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a crowne of thornes.

<pb facs="tcp:26121:5"/>
               <hi>Eden,</hi> waſh his Church with his bloud; crying with feare, that wee might cry in faith; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the anguiſh of his ſoule, in his feeling, as if hee were left not of Angels or men (that was but little) but of God his Father, crying <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> At this voyce the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe it could not beare ſo great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as the Croſſe. The Croſſe trembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bare Chriſt, Chriſt trembled and was in a bloudy ſweat,
<pb facs="tcp:26121:6"/>becauſe he had ſo great, ſo heauy, and ſo inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable a weight; for firſt he bare our perſons, ſecondly, hee bare our ſinnes, a great burden; thirdly, hee bare the floud of Gods anger and iuſtice powred on him for our ſinnes. At this moſt dreadfull cry which at once mooued all the powers of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, the Sun was eclipſed, and that contrary to its courſe and cuſtome, which made a Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to cry, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature ſuffered, or
<pb facs="tcp:26121:6"/>the world was at an end; and mooued the Centurion to ſay, <hi>Verily this was a iuſt man, this was the Sonne of God;</hi> the Sunne was eclipſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Sonne of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, not onely eclipſed with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body of the earth, of his humane nature; but alſo eclipſed with the veile of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yea, the very ſtones were rent aſunder, and the graues were opened. Euery creature, ſaith S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> ſuffereth with Chriſt at his ſuffering;
<pb facs="tcp:26121:7"/>the Sunne is darkned, the earth mooued, the rockes cleaue aſunder, the veile of the Temple diuided, the graues ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; only miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffereth not with Chriſt, for whom alone Chriſt ſuffered. Leſt therefore we ſhew our ſelues vnſenſible, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, let vs conſider his paſſion with compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with faith, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; and as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, behold the wounds of patient Chriſt, the bloud of him dying, the price of our
<pb facs="tcp:26121:7"/>redemption; conſider what they are, &amp; weigh them in the ballance of thy heart, that hee may be wholly fixed in thy heart, that was for thee wholly faſtned on the croſſe. And in it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the loue of God the Father, the charity, the humility, the patience of God the Sonne, who loued vs his enemies more than himſelfe; conſider our ſinnes and wounds which were healed by the precious balme of his bloud. Conſider Oman (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) how great are
<pb facs="tcp:26121:8"/>thoſe wounds for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which the Lord Chriſt muſt needs bee wounded: If theſe wounds had not beene deadly, yea, and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, the Sonne of God would neuer haue died that he might cure them. Beſides, we muſt crucifie our ſinnes, our members, as Chriſt was crucified; be crucified to the world, the world crucified to vs; he alone (ſaith <hi>S. Hierom</hi>) can glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the croſſe who takes it vp, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt, who crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his fleſh &amp; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.
<pb facs="tcp:26121:8"/>So then we muſt crucifie our heart, that it may die to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cogitations; crucifie our hands, ſo that they may haue no life to commit euill actions; crucifie our eyes, that they take no delight to gaze on worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; crucifie our eares, that they liſten not to fruitleſſe and friuolous words; crucifie our tongue, yea, crucifie the old man that hath been a tenant ſo long, and hath had his habitation in our boſome, that he being dead hee may be
<pb facs="tcp:26121:9"/>carried to his graue; that our ſoule may be infected no longer with his carnall impiety, and that wee may no longer loue but loathe, and for euer leaue his damnable company.</p>
            <p>Beſides the crucifying of the old man, we muſt ſuffer and beare afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as pouerty, croſſes, ſickneſſe, temptations, for what meruaile? If God did afflict his Son for our ſinnes, if he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vs for our own: and God had in the arke of the Couenant both Manna, and the rod of
<pb facs="tcp:26121:9"/>
               <hi>Aaron;</hi> ſhewing that as a Father hee nouriſheth vs, and as a Father hee chaſtiſeth vs as his Sonnes, and theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are enſignes &amp; markes of his loue: So ſaith Chriſt, I reproue &amp; chaſtiſe thoſe whom I loue. So <hi>Iacob</hi> whom he loued, and <hi>Moſes</hi> the beloued of God and man. And <hi>Dauid</hi> a man according to GODS heart. So <hi>Solomon</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iedidia, i.</hi> the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, yet if hee ſinne, God will chaſtiſe him as a Father his Son; for God chaſtiſeth vs to
<pb facs="tcp:26121:10"/>humble vs, to make vs haue zeale and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to try our faith, obedience, patience, hope; as <hi>Iob, Though thou kill me, yet will I hope in thee;</hi> and theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea armies of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God ſendeth againſt his children to chaſtiſe them, not to hurt them; as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſent his armie againſt <hi>Abſolon, Deale gently (for my ſake) with the young man, euen with Abſolon.</hi> He reproueth vs not in his fury, but in his mercy, according to our deſire, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs theſe vipers of
<pb facs="tcp:26121:10"/>afflictions, that we may ſhake them off as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and make an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, &amp; treackle againſt ſinne and death; for they are not vnto death, as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> at leaſt not vnto eternall death, but Chariots to carry vs vp to Heauen, for by afflictions wee muſt enter into the kingdome of heauen. Neither is this all, for wee muſt goe forth vnto Chriſt out of the camp, to beare reproaches &amp; croſſes for Chriſt; for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the paſſion of
<pb facs="tcp:26121:11"/>Chriſt, there is nothing ſo difficult but wee will patiently endure, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring according to his commandement his croſſe after him. And <hi>Simon Cyrenaeus</hi> exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to carry Chriſts croſſe for him, firſt, becauſe he did beare the croſſe and reproach, yea died: now if the head, then much more the members; if that was done to the green wood, then much more to the dry wood; the ſeruants condition ought not to be better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the maſters: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Chriſt did
<pb facs="tcp:26121:11"/>beare our reproach, died for vs; and therefore with <hi>Thomas</hi> let vs goe and die with him, and for him: thirdly, becauſe the reproches which we endure for Chriſt, are not tearmed ours but his; ſo Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Yee ſhall drinke of my cup.</hi> And <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cyrenaeus</hi> could not ſay I beare mine owne croſſe, but Chriſts croſſe becauſe he bare Chriſts croſſe, and for Chriſt. And therefore <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I beare in my body the markes of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and that in three reſpects.</p>

Firſt, As a member of Chriſt; for as the marke on the hand or forehead redounds not to that member, but to all the members, to the head, yea to the whole perſon, and that hand ſhould not be branded, but that it is the hand of ſuch a perſon; ſo the Chriſtians branded and marked becauſe the members of Chriſt, Chriſt is bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, marked, whipped in their perſon. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are they whipt in priſon? Chriſt is whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their perſon; Chriſt, though in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="tcp:26121:12"/>yet he ſaid, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, for if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury offered to an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour redounds to the King who ſends him; ſo the diſhonour offered by <hi>Hanun</hi> King of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> vnto the Ambaſſadours of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> redounded vnto King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he reuenged himſelfe on the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> then the diſhonour offered to Chriſts Ambaſſadours and Miniſters redounds to Chriſt himſelfe; for
<pb facs="tcp:26121:13"/>
               <hi>who receiueth you, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mee; who reiecteth you, reiecteth mee; who diſhonoureth you, diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, As a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for as a ſouldier who receiueth wounds and skarres in his Princes quarels, or for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſake, dares ſay hee beares his Princes wounds, the skarres of his Country; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> beares the skarres and markes of Chriſt Ieſus, hee beares on him (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith) the enſignes of honour, hee is not aſhamed of them,
<pb facs="tcp:26121:13"/>but he ſhews them open to the whole world; as Emperours that carrie openly their Coronets, Diadems, and precious ornaments; and as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers choſen out of companies to vndertake ſome enter prize, thinke themſelues honoured (though they vndergoe thoſe dangers with the danger of their liues) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are preferred before the reſt, though there be no merit: ſo the Apoſtles reioyced in that they were thought worthy to be whipped for Chriſt his ſake; and
<pb facs="tcp:26121:14"/>as a ſouldier is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew his wounds to the world. So <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> hauing an eye loſt in warre was not aſhamed thereof, but glorying in it ſaid, that others keepe in their houſes their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and other marks of victory, but he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his body. Yea as men, yea noblemen thinke themſelues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the order of a King; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the order of the Garter, though in it ſelfe it is a matter of nought: it is but a Garter, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of a royall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb facs="tcp:26121:14"/>and a King hath made this order, and held thoſe Knights of that order to be his brethren and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo though ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, reproaches, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, &amp; chaines, are vile, and naught in its ſelfe, and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the world, yet are they honourable to the Saints, Angels, &amp; God, becauſe they are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chriſt: the croſſe is his order, the chaines are the order of Chriſts gates; and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme more of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:26121:15"/>of the reproach of Chriſt, than of all the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, There is no nobler order of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry, nor no better and fairer colours than the chaines wherewith the Martyrs of Chriſt are chained and manacled with, and there are not more precious brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets than the manacles wherwith the hands are chained. And it is ſaid in the Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Babylas</hi> the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detained in a filthy
<pb facs="tcp:26121:15"/>and villanous priſon for the name of Chriſt, wherein he died, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt his friends that came to viſite him, that after his death they ſhould bury with him his ornaments &amp; marks of his valour, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chaines wherwith his hands and feet were chained. So our holy Martyrs in the time of Queene <hi>Marie</hi> did kiſſe the chaines and ſtakes wherewith they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed to aſhes; nay, euen Kings haue much eſteemed thoſe skarres, and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:26121:16"/>that haue ſuffered for the name of Chriſt, as the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> who did kiſſe the holes of the eies and the skarres of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe markes of the <hi>Arians,</hi> for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſts deity. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> deſired to ſee the duſt of that body, namely of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that had borne the markes of the Lord Ieſus. By theſe markes and skarres are the faithfull Chriſtian Martyrs knowne, for theſe skarres as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb facs="tcp:26121:16"/>ſhall they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. For as. <hi>Arthur</hi> the Kings body being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp ſomewhat more than 600 yeeres after his death, was knowne to be his by nothing ſo much as by the print of ten ſeuerall wounds which appeared in his skull; and as Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection had his skarres and wounds whereby he was known; ſo ſhall the faithfull bee knowne, not hauing wounds or skarres, for their body ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding knowne of God, of
<pb facs="tcp:26121:17"/>Angels, of Saints, yea of their perſecutors, for they ſhall ſee them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue pierced, yea thoſe perſecutors that haue borne the marke of the Beaſt, of Antichriſt againſt Chriſt, againſt his Goſpell; and others that haue carried skars of their villanies, of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, whoredome, and riot, and borne their owne croſſe, which as bad Carpenters &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men they haue he wen vnto themſelues; for it is not the marke, nor the death, but the cauſe that maketh the
<pb facs="tcp:26121:17"/>Martyr: they as bearing the marke of the world, the deuill, and the fleſh, ſhall be caſt into vtter darkneſſe; but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bearing the markes and skarres of Chriſt, ſhall triumph for euer. For as the people of <hi>Rome</hi> would haue hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> after his victory to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, there was one that ſtood vp, and made an oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his behalfe, in the midſt whereof he caſt open his gowne, &amp; ſhewed before them the infinite skarres and cuts hee had receiued vpon
<pb facs="tcp:26121:18"/>his breaſt, the ſight whereof preuailed with the people, that they all agreed in one, &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Aemilius</hi> his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, which he did in the ſight of all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and went to the Capitoll. So God (the Angels alſo) beholding the reproaches, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wounds, yea, death, which wee haue endured for his ſake, &amp; being marked vpon our foreheads by the Angel, and hauing the ſeale of the liuing God; maugre the Deuill, the fleſh, the world, we ſhall triumph
<pb facs="tcp:26121:18"/>in the view of all the world, in the high Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll of Heauen, &amp; there liue eternally.</p>
            <p>But leſt I draw my lines beyond the limits of due meaſure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed an Epiſtle, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch a ſmall booke, or ſhape <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhooe for a childes foot, or make the gates &amp; walls too big for the Citty, I here breake off.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26121:19"/>Pleſsis,</hi> I haue tranſlated them; and as Orphans and poſthumes after their Fathers deceaſe, I haue cloathed them in a ſtrange habit, making them that ſpake French before, to ſpeake Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; which I preſume to preſent to your Honor, and publiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in your name to the world, that by your countenance, &amp; vnder the wings of your Honourable protection it may ſafely walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to the view and benefit of others, and that it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Church, it
<pb facs="tcp:26121:19"/>being no new faſhion for thoſe that publiſh any bookes whether of greater or leſſer worth, whether their owne or others, vnleſſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch workes wherein they haue beene tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to preſent them to great and worthy perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages. It were infinite to inſtance this point.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſome reaſons that haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to dedicate this Poſthume vnto your Honour; Firſt, becauſe great men are content and deſire to reade great mens workes; So
<pb facs="tcp:26121:20"/>the Eunuch of <hi>Candace</hi> did reade the Prophet <hi>Eſaias,</hi> of the Royall bloud, and Kings and Princes doe reade the bookes of Kings and Princes. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as this Noble man had his Motto, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; Marte:</hi> So your Honour as <hi>Alexander</hi> may bee repreſented with a Horſe and a Booke, the one to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your deſire to marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all indeuours, the other your diligence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in letters. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had no ſooner off his Helmet, but he took
<pb facs="tcp:26121:20"/>in hand <hi>Homers Iliads;</hi> So you delight not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Martiall actiuitie, but fauour the ſtudy of good letters. Thirdly, becauſe they are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and haue need of a good and powerfull Patron in a forreine land, and deſerue to be beloued and protected for their Fathers ſake, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans.</hi> Beſides, to whom doth a Treatiſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, more fitly agree, than to him that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth godlineſſe, and hath the power of it dwelling in his heart? or
<pb facs="tcp:26121:21"/>to whom ſhould I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the patronage of truth, better than to him that is a fauourer and a louer of the truth, and of ſuch as loue the truth? your true zeale and deſire of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ieſus Chriſt crucified, your care to maintaine the honour of God, your conſtant profeſſion, practiſe, and defence of the ſame Truth and Religion, which you haue beene borne and bred in; to this may be added mine own deſire to giue ſome teſtimony of my dutie
<pb facs="tcp:26121:21"/>to your Lordſhip, which could not ſuffer me elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to ſeeke the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Orphane vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume; not doubting but your Honour will accept it in good part. <hi>Apelles</hi> drawing the counterfeit of Honour, pourtrayed her holding in the one hand a ſtarre, in the other a ſtone; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that although Noble mindes ſhould reach as high as the skie, yet they ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to looke as low as the earth. The widdow in the Goſpell offered a little mony, the woman
<pb facs="tcp:26121:22"/>a little oyle to her Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a few drops from the hands of a poore <hi>Cynetas. Mercurie</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to drinke of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> earthen pot; <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> tooke a Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> accepted a bunch of grapes preſented by a ſimple countreyman; and his ſonne <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> did <hi>parua libenter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere;</hi> all of them did rather conſider the mind of the giuer than the gift. I know your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will kindly accept my ſmall Mite, if you
<pb facs="tcp:26121:22"/>ballance it with the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of my minde. If you iudge them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, vouchſafe your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage; if not, your pardon, at leaſt your gracious and fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptance. Thus crauing pardon for my boldneſſe, I ceaſe to trouble your Honour, not to pray for you; the Lord eſtabliſh your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in euery good word, and make you rich in name and fame by your good works, to his glory, to the good of his Church, to your euerlaſting Honour in

God therefore to whom already thou oweſt what thou art by creation,

            <p>But it may be this leſſon is too high for thee.

And thou ſeeſt the brethren of Chriſt, his owne members, freeze with cold, faint with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at thy doore.

And thou knoweſt, O Lord, if I haue a deſire therof, and if continually I aske for thy Spirit to better mee. But thou wilt doe more, O Lord, for thy rods are the medicines of the ſoule.

But, O Lord, our paine continueth, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when thou doeſt afflict vs, is it not to rowze in vs the ſenſe of ſinne? Well, but now I feele it. Is it not to breake our hearts? Behold, my heart is broken, ſoftned, ſoaked in teares before thee. Is it not to bow vs to repentance. Why, O Lord,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26121:53"/>I am diſpleaſed in my ſelfe, and with my ſelfe, hereafter will I doe nought but pleaſe thee, will not pleaſe my ſelfe but in thee.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26121:53"/>is a hard and ſtrict Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour? And vnto whom doeſt thou crie? Who is too much diuerted to heare thee, too farre to hearken vnto thee? vnto whom cry, how long? who is aboue yeares, ages and times, with whom a thouſand yeares is as one day, thy longings and languiſhings are leſſe to him than a moment. Certainly, O Lord, for all that, how high ſoeuer thou art, the moſt lowlieſt and humbleſt doe attaine vnto thee; how much retired ſoeuer thou ſeemeſt to bee, thou art neuer farre from the hearts of the afflicted. So is it alſo, O Lord, that thy eternity makes thee not ignorant of the time,

My God, it is ſaid that thou ſeeſt what is done, that thou maiſt iudge the world.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26121:56"/>withdrawne from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and condemnation of this peruerſe generation. And this is that aſpect of thy mercie, thy good eye of thy good grace, when thou doeſt behold vs in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of thy Welbeloued, who is made vnto vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and iuſtice; iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which makes thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie iuſt, who will not, nor cannot ſhew mercie, but in iuſtice.

But againe; certes, not for any thing that this aſpect of thy mercie findes

I know it, O Lord, and I feele it. I feele it, and grant mee by thy Spirit, that I may bee more and more ſenſible thereof. But, O Lord, our goodneſſe did not moue thee to make vs,

Saue vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in thy Chriſt, euen by that bountie, and that by vs and in vs this goodneſſe may be acknowledged, and thou glorified, who haſt begotten vs, and renewed vs, created and regenerated vs, for thy glorie, to render thy goodneſſe glorious and famous on earth; Saue vs for that ſelfe ſame glorie.</p>

            <p>O Lord, the ſinnes (wee confeſſe it) which are in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26121:57"/>the ſoule, are cauſes of the euils which we endure here on earth. And therefore ſaid I, <hi>Deliuer my ſoule, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer my ſoule;</hi> that is to ſay, Forgiue me my ſinne, for it is the ſlauerie of ſinne that bindes it. For if the Son makes vs not free, if he bindes not the ſtrong ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who hath vs in hold, how ſhall wee euer ſee our ſelues ſet free? and when he ſhall haue made me free, I am aſſured that euen this bodie of mine ſhall finde ſome eaſe. For what meant he, when as he healing one ſicke of the palſie, ſaid to him; <hi>Sonne, thy ſinnes bee forgiuen thee?</hi> but this, namely, that for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this remiſſion, I

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I ſaid with the Prophet, <hi>Turne thou to me, and deliuer my ſoule, and ſaue me;</hi> that is to ſay, Turne thou to mee, and I will turne to thee; and when I ſhall returne to thee, thou ſhalt forgiue me my ſinnes, and ſhalt deliuer mee from all my euils. So Lord, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſelfe wholly loſt in my ſelfe, I ſeeke for all in thee; I aske of thee the knowledge of my ſinne, contrition, conuerſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and life, and the life
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26121:58"/>I ſay, both of this body &amp; of this ſoule, that I may owe, and owe againe and againe all vnto thee; and that I may glorifie thee both in bodie and ſoule. O Lord, it is the prayer which thy ſeruant hath elſe-where taughtime:<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.7, 8.</note>

But, O Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vnto vs our life, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vs our health, which is the life of our life, and without the which life is but a ſhadow of life, and our life ſhall be vnto thee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Sacrifice, vnto thee a perpetuall Canticle.

And finally (O God) that all that is within vs and of vs, with heart, with voyce, with action, may meditate on thee, praiſe thee, ſerue thee, and that not for ſome dayes, but for many yeeres; for, O Lord, I know that long life is giuen as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto thoſe that feare thee; whoſe bones thou preſerueſt, ſo that they are not broken; whoſe liues

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:26121:65"/>with ſorrow in my ſoule, in danger to yeeld my ſelfe vnto the words of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed, who vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling of ſuch rude blowes, did murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me; Where is now his God, that God whom he did call vpon ſo oft; my ſelfe to mutter between my teeth; where are indeed thoſe infinite bounties? And wherefore haſt thou ſued mee as an aduerſary, haſt made me a But to thy moſt rough arrowes? I heare the wiſe man mildly ſaying, <hi>My ſonne, deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: For whom the Lord loueth hee correcteth, euen as a father the ſonne in

            <p>At this word I breathe a little, and come by little &amp; little to my ſelfe: this word as good ſtrong Vinegar comforts my ſpirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores my pulſe, brings me out of ſounding, reſtores life to my ſoule; one drop of this ſoure ſweet liquor on my tongue baked with griefe refreſheth it, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth its blackneſſe, yea, its language. Why then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan I to ſay to my ſoule, this deſpaire will it change into hope? From a Iudge, O Lord, whom I did dread thee, and an angry Iudge, ſhal I feele thee as a Father, a louing Father? ſhall it be then true, that theſe rude chaſtiſements are to mee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26121:66"/>ſignes of thy loue, ſeales of mine adoption, the earneſt of my ſaluation, and firſt-fruits of thy grace? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I hold this liquor in my palate, gargariſe my mouth therewith, that it may penetrate my heart, go to the bottome of my ſoule; for when men are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, it is from Gods hand; in this hand will he be heard, with this hand he ſpeaketh. And theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are chaſtiſements to his owne, though pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments to others; with the ſame hand he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them and heale them, with the ſame rod he beats them downe and raiſeth them vp, beats downe the fleſh, raiſeth the ſoule. If
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26121:66"/>you behold the wound its opening, and the bloud he drawes from vs, he ſeemes not much differing from an enemy; if his ſoft hand, if his tender affection, if his wholeſome intention, ſeeing hee is thy Creator, thy Redeemer, how much doth he exceed any Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be he neuer ſo much thy friend, yea, any father whatſoeuer?</p>
            <p>And it is alwaies a great point for vs to conſider, that our afflictions come from God, make a part of his prouidence. For to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the creature ought to yeeld to the whole and ſoueraigne power of the Creator, (we doe yeeld ſo much to the power of a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26121:67"/>Prince, and that without reply) All-wiſe and iuſt that he is, can he doe any thing either without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or without iuſtice? and are they not therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trials of our faith, or chaſtiſements of our ſins? yea, all good that he is, a louer of his creature, can he doe ought but in goodnes? in mercy w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſurpaſſeth all his works? to the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore of his Church? to our owne ſaluation? <hi>for our profit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>that we may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holineſſe,</hi> wee may profit in holineſſe, we may walke from faith to faith, from obedience to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>

It is therefore as much as if hee ſhould ſay, vndergoe it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, take it in good part; ſuppoſe it to be a leſſon which he giues thee in his

A diſcipline alſo on thy part in its effect, if thou takeſt well thy chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doeſt amend, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne more and more vnto him. Take it therefore in good part, husband it well, for he addeth, <hi>neither be weary of his correction.</hi>

            <p>Not onely deſpiſe it not,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26121:69"/>but vndergoe it, not for once, but often; if he redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if he return often to it, be not weary of it. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is not weary of the mildeſt reprehenſions of his beſt friends, and whoſe eares and head are not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therewith? Why then when God redoubleth his blowes on men, and that with ſo heauie a hand, who can ſubſiſt? I, but attend with patience, and be not weary thereof: Certes we haue the ſame reaſon both to ſuffer this chaſtiſement, &amp; to perſeuere in this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if we conſider that it is God who continues it, all iuſt, all wiſe; he doth it for our good, who is all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all mercy. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:26121:69"/>we doe not complaine of the Phyſitian who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs at ſeuerall times, nor of the Surgion who ſearcheth the wound, and that ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a day, though it be neuer without paine, yea ſmarting paine; when God dreſſeth our ſinne, an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate euill, a mortall plague cleauing to our ſpirits, yea, to our marrow, ſhall wee complaine if hee reſumes the Launcer, preſſeth the venome out, applies at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times the ſearing iron, or the cautere? according as the vlcer threatens an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, or that the humour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth it ſelfe againſt the cataplaſme, according as we are, and he knoweth vs, redoubleth his viſitation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:26121:70"/>either with the Launcet, or the Doſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be not</hi> (therefore) <hi>weary when the Lord doth correct thee;</hi> why then, what ſhall wee doe? accuſtome our ſelues to Gods rod, become lumpiſh or vnſenſible? But on the contrary, God will haue thee to feele him, to vnderſtand him, feele his blowes, know the cauſe thereof, feele thy ſelfe by them, and woe vnto him that rouſeth himſelfe not vp. Hee loues the childe that vnderſtands him at halfe a word, that is not dul, but is ſenſible of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, ſhakes at the very ſhadow of his rod. Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not a ſtupidity or a want of apprehenſion of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:26121:70"/>griefe in paine; it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth on the contrary a griefe, a ſuffering, but the quicker the paine is, the greater is the patience, which proceedeth from faith, and produceth alſo obedience; faith, which maketh vs turne our eye to the cauſe, rather than carry our hand to the ſore: Faith, which makes thee mount vp to God, to receiue from his hand that which hee pleaſeth to giue, to deſcend into thy ſelfe, to examine thy ſoule, turne ouer the leaues of thy conſcience, to finde there that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth him, to diſlike thy ſelfe, confeſſe thy debt, haue recourſe to his benignity.

            <p>But here the fleſh repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Why, ſaith it, ſhall affliction be a marke of the children of God? why then all they who are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtized, are they his children? Contrariwiſe, looke about you, ſee in how many ſorts this marke is defectiue. I but the wiſe man ſaith not, that all thoſe whom God ſtrikes are his children, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ſhould become of his iudgments, ſo frequent on ſtrangers, on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? But he meanes that all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26121:77"/>his children, thoſe to whom he vouchſafeth to be in his houſe, are ſubiect to feele his hand; and children as they are of his mercie, they feele it not in his anger, as thoſe children of wrath; but in his mercie. And wilt thou know the difference? thoſe impute it to fortune, to nature, to miſchance, thinke on nought but on their paine; if any thought of God enters perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their mindes, they ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it preſently, ready to doe worſe if they doe but eſcape. Theſe in their paine feele the hand of God, thinke on their ſinne, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their paine; conuince themſelues, and conuicted, humble themſelues at the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:26121:77"/>foot of his clemencie; more aſhamed of their offence than of their puniſhment, more confounded in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before the benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſuch a father, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inflamed anger of the moſt rigorous Iudge; walking henceforth warily, not ſo much for feare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring his indignation, as out of a deſire not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing vnworthy of his adoption, of his family. So doe we read of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he feeles the lice and ſwarms of flies, &amp; the other rods of God, according as he doth redouble them, he grieueth, is diſquieted, is impatient, makes a capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with God; but eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones returneth, who is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:26121:78"/>that God, whom you doe ſo much alleage? it is maruell hee ſaith not, Let mee ſee him, and thereupon hee hardneth his heart. Gods rod went but to his backe, little ſenſible thereof in his ſoule. On the contrary, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſees the deſtroying Angell ſmiting his people, threatning very neere his owne perſon, forgets his owne danger for his ſinne, readie to redeeme Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the loſſe of his life; <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.17.</note> 
               <hi>Lee I haue ſinned,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>I haue done wickedly; but theſe ſheepe, what haue theſe done? let thine hand I pray thee be againſt mee, and againſt my fathers houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſenſible of his ſinne, inſenſible of his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:26121:78"/>paines. <hi>Grieue not</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>when God chaſteneth thee,</hi> rather grieue when he correcteth thee not; feare that hee hath forgot thee, and left thee to thy ſelfe: thou oughteſt to ſuſpect thoſe proſperities which thou drinkeſt in long draughts. The ſicke man, who hath neuer ſo little iudgement, takes it for an ill ſigne, when the Phyſitian permits him to take any thing, lets him drinke wine in his full feuer, becauſe he forbids nothing to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſicke folkes, hee neuer maketh inciſion on thoſe that are mortally wounded; there is both reaſon and art to let them die at leaſure.</p>
            <p>I but it is the correction
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:26121:79"/>of a father, the chaſtiſement of a ſonne, to cut off an arme or leg, pull out our eyes or bowels; and ſhall wee not thinke that theſe words ſerue rather to lull vs aſleepe? for what could the greateſt enemie doe to vs more in the heat of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? I but vnaduiſed fleſh refraine thy ſelfe, it is God that ſpeakes: and if thy vine could ſpeake, and ſhould vpbraid thee, and tell thee how often thou makeſt it to weepe, when thou cutſt it, and cutſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, leaueſt but a twig in an vnaſſured hope notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of more fruit; Good husband-man, as thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe to be, wouldſt thou not mock
